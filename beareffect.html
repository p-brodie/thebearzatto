						<p>Authentic Show Gains Exposure for Chicago Restaurants and City</p>

						<p>FX’s “The Bear” <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/maps/the-bear-fx-hulu-tv-chicago-guide-to-restaurants-film-locations">features tons of different restaurants in Chicago</a> during the “Sundae” episode where chef Sydney, played by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ayoedebiri/">Ayo Edebiri</a>, travels around Chicago to cleanse her palette and find potential menu favorites for their grand opening of The Bear. Mikey’s original restaurant, The Beef, was modeled after <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mrbeefonorleans/">Mr. Beef</a>, an Italian beef restaurant that “The Bear’s” creator Christopher Storer went to regularly. After filming the pilot at Mr. Beef and airing the episode “Sundae,” “The exposure the show has given these restaurants is leading to something of a “Bear effect” on their businesses: greater visibility, higher profiles, and — crucially — more customers” (Worthington & Wroblewski, 2023). Lots of Chicago restaurants have now been featured in the show, each having a similar “Bear Effect” on their business.</p>

								<p>Making the details accurate and paying homage to the culture of Chicago are two things “The Bear” does best. It not only features authentic cuisine and favorite local restaurants, but also gives special attention to popular attractions and musicians from the area. The soundtrack features songs from Mavis Staples, Wilco, and Smashing Pumpkins. Even the baseball card that the Faks are trying to get ahold of in “Fishes” features Roberto Clemente, who has a high school named after him in the Humboldt Park neighborhood. All Chicago residents are feeling “The Bear Effect” as Mortell writes, “From stunning skyline shots to music from local artists like Mavis Staples, this season of The Bear is a true love letter to Chicago” (2023).</p>
