						<p>“Fishes,” is probably the most riveting episode of FX’s “The Bear” to date. This hour-long holiday special in season two showcases amazing acting skills from the cast and brings in more powerful lines from <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/jamieleecurtis/">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/johnmulaney/?hl=en">John Mulaney</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therealbobodenkirk/">Bob Odenkirk</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mssarahcatharinepaulson/?hl=en">Sara Paulson</a>. This episode packed full of family drama and darkness shows the stresses of the kitchen at home, cousin Richie’s relationship with his ex-wife, and the mannerisms and abrasiveness of Mikey (Jon Bernthal). The family gathers the day before Christmas in Chicago to celebrate with the Seven Fishes. The one question stumping everyone that Stevie (John Mulaney) tries to answer is: what is the Feast of the Seven Fishes?</p>

								<p>Originating in Southern Italy, the Feast of the Seven Fishes (known as The Vigil in Italy) is an Italian American tradition celebrated on December 24th, Christmas Eve. Why celebrate with a bunch of different fish? One: the Feast is a Roman/Catholic holiday and participants are discouraged from eating meat before the holy day of December 25th. Two: in Italy 1861, Freya Berg from Food Network Kitchen describes, “southern regions were the poorest areas in the country, and fish was a plentiful food source. The area became so poverty-stricken millions of people left and immigrated to the U.S. bringing their food traditions with them” (Berg, 2022). The number seven remains a mystery for this feast. <a href="https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/a34304524/feast-of-the-seven-fishes/">An article from The Pioneer Woman</a> reads, “some people claim the number seven symbolizes the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church while others say it’s meant to represent the seven days of the week or the seven hills of Rome” (O’Brien & Zauberman, 2023). Whatever the significance is, Stevie chokes out an explanation of his own, claiming that the seven dishes each need to be prepared in a different way that takes lots of time and care. It’s a time for the Berzattos to get together and celebrate having their difficult family and the love they share with each other and their food.</p>
