						<p>In Season 2 of “The Bear,” during the dismantling and rebranding process of Carmy’s restaurant, Sydney declares that she wants to get a star. The show doesn’t describe what a star is even how to get one really, but this season does allude to the importance of having one or more from when Carmy tells Sydney about the pressures and anxiety of his three-star restaurant days and the significance of Richie staging at Ever, “the world’s best restaurant” in the episode “Forks.” So, what does a star actually do for a restaurant and how does one even get them?</p>

								<p>The Michelin Guide started in 1900 when the company known for its tires started encouraging people on road trips to stop at local attractions. The guide included, “European restaurant reviews that focused on the quality of food served, mastery of culinary technique, and personality of dishes” (ICE, 2022). In 2005, restaurants became eligible for Michelin stars. A restaurant can have up to three Michelin stars. <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/article/features/what-is-a-michelin-star">Restaurants are rated on five universal criteria</a> including: quality of the ingredients, harmony of the flavors, mastery of techniques, personality of the chefs in their food, and consistency across the menu and over time. Restaurants holding a star are reassessed annually, “to ensure the same high standard of cooking is being offered to guests” (MICHELIN Guide, 2022). Knowing the history and criteria, <a href="https://www.ice.edu/blog/michelin-stars">what does each star mean?</a></p>

									<ul>
									<li>One star – The restaurant is very good for its category with a quality menu and high-standard cuisine.</li>
									<li>Two stars – The restaurant has excellent cuisine delivered in a unique way and is “worth a detour.”</li>
									<li>Three stars – The restaurant has exceptional cuisine and is “worth a special journey,” just to experience it.</li></p>
